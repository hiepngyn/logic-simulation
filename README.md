# Logic Simulation

A program which allows users to create simulations of digital logic.

## Currently Supports

- Logic Gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT)
- Connections via wires to Power Supplies
- Simple logic gate simulation through aformentioned controls
## Roadmap

-  Sandbox Mode allowing users to create whatever circuit you want.
- Templates of other circuits
- Other objects such as switches, LEDs, 7-Segment displays, and more.
